    projectName: 'Portfolio Website',
    projectDescription: `When I design an application, my goal is to create what is necessary, and nothing more. I'm a huge fan of minimalist design, so with this portfolio site, the last thing I wanted to do was sacrifice user-experience or the ability to quickly access information for the sake of flashy animations and the like. Even the generic buttons are intentional. (I personally love the combination of a gray background, square corners and IBM font.)`,

    projectName: 'Kaiju Calculator',
    projectDescription: `Even though I try to build applications to improve my skills, I tend to design them for my kids, and this one was no different. This particular idea came to mind as I was thinking of how funny it\'d be for someone to be pulled over by the police for not knowing what a speed limit of "1770 Godzillas Per Hour" meant. People may debate whether the heights of the monsters are correct (depending on the movie), but the math checks out. I promise.`,
